# Object Oreinted Programming
This repository aims to create an Object-Oriented Program akin to SeqIO, a popular bioinformatics library, with three modules: Sequence, FASTA, and FASTQ. 
The main program served as a command-line interface for the modules, enabling users to input files and obtain basic metrics such as total sequence count, average GC content, and minimum and maximum sequence length etc.
